# Measuring Consistency in Text-based Financial Forecasting Models

<!--  If you find this repository help your research, please cite our following paper: Linyi Yang, Yingpeng Ma, Yue Zhang. Measuring Consistency in Text-based Financial Forecasting Models. -->

## Intro
The repository for ACL-2023 paper "Measuring Consistency in Text-based Financial Forecasting Models".
We provide our code and dataset used for the paper. 

## Dataset
The raw dataset of the earnings call can be found from [Qin and Yang, ACL-19](https://github.com/GeminiLn/EarningsCall_Dataset).
Previous works all have divided the earnings call dataset into mutually exclusive train/validation/test sets in a 7:1:2 ratio based on chronological order. 
In line with this approach, we obtained the testset and expanded the testset by generating four consistency test sets to evaluate the consistency for model.

## Code
Also, we have provided the code we used to generate consistency test examples, to enable researchers to extend their own datasets into a form suitable for testing consistency.
